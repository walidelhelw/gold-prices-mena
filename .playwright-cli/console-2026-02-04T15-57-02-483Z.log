[   15960ms] [WARNING] Blocked aria-hidden on an element because its descendant retained focus. The focus must not be hidden from assistive technology users. Avoid using aria-hidden on a focused element or its ancestor. Consider using the inert attribute instead, which will also prevent focus. For more details, see the aria-hidden section of the WAI-ARIA specification at https://w3c.github.io/aria/#aria-hidden.
Element with focus: <div.sZwd7c B6Vhqe>
Ancestor with aria-hidden: <div.Ih3FE> @ https://accounts.google.com/v3/signin/identifier?continue=https://accounts.google.com/signin/chrome/sync/finish?est%3DAEmG5eBRFzZVCbQQe40thG3hqw8_WytWVQr9iQYbJyk_FLv5f8bqxdHnOLC_mJg_F2cYLFkrvRFygRUTKd4OvdY%26continue%3Dhttps://www.google.com/&ssp=1&theme=mn&flowName=GlifDesktopChromeSync&dsh=S101279801:1770220631393268:0
